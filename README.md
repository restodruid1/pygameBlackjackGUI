# GUI Blackjack Game in Python
This app was an attempt to branch out of my comfort zone and write a program that involved more than the CLI so I chose to create a GUI application of Blackjack.
I began this project with the idea of writing clean and clear code but when I hit a brick wall, I decided to write what worked and I ended up with this.  
EDIT*: gamefileRefactored is an updated version of the game with respect to the code. I revisited this project a few months later to see how I have progessed and if I could write cleaner, more understandable code.
# Installation
Download the game file and have Pygame installed and it should work.
# Features
The game allows the user to hit, stand, double down, or split. It also tells the user who won or lost. Dealer stands on a soft 17.
# Future
Hoping to add a money/chip feature.  
EDIT*: gamefileRefactored added this feature.
